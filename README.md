1 Identify Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)
2 Identify cardiovascular disease (CVD)
3 Identify heart failure
4 Manipulate data for analyses
5 Create cardiovascular MRI outcomes
6 Conduct regressions

These scripts are part of the analysis for the paper titled: Higher Aircraft Noise Exposure is Linked to Worse Heart Structure and Function by Cardiovascular MRI, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

The data used for the analysis come from the UK Biobank dataset.
